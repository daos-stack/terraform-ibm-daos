# terraform-ibm-daos

Terraform modules for deploying [Distributed Asynchronous Object Storage (DAOS)](https://docs.daos.io/v2.2/)  on IBM Cloud

**Not recommended for production!**

The Terraform modules in this repo are in the early stages of development.

## Deploy a DAOS Cluster on IBM Cloud

The [examples](examples/) directory contains Terraform configurations that can be used to deploy a DAOS Cluster on IBM Cloud.

- [examples/daos_cluster](examples/daos_cluster/README.md) can be used to deploy a DAOS cluster in an existing VPC.
- [examples/daos_cluster_new_vpc](examples/daos_cluster_new_vpc/README.md) can be used to deploy a DAOS cluster in a new VPC.

The [daos_cluster_new_vpc](examples/daos_cluster_new_vpc/README.md) example is preferred as it creates a dedicated VPC. This example is the quickest way to get started.

## DAOS Versions

The examples in this repo deploy DAOS v2.2
